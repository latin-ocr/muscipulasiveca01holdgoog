My Gon compassionate as Just
The bands of my confine-ment burst,
Redeem’d my body from the dust,
And bade my soul return:

Untir’d, his patience knows no bound,
Amazing is his grace!

While three long years

Have roll’d their circles round,

I’ve stood a cumberer of the ground 3

Have oft provok’d him to his sace,
And yet his mercy calle, and yet his wrath fot-bears.

Guu· Gon Ξ on such a stupid creature, why
Dost show’r thy blessings down;
who not deserves the notice of thine eye,
And yet provokes thy frown?
1 would review
The kindness thou hast shown,
With wonder and confusion too,
How good art thou, O Gon! but, how unthanksul 1!
Vast is the debt of gratitude Ι owe,
For mercies great beyond the bounds of thought3
How should my bosom glow,
With sacred flames, and blesa the gentle blow
Os thy chastising rod!
