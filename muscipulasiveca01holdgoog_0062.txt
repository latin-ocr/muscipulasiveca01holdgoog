THE CELEBRATED ODE OF SAPPHO,

mANsLA'rED mro nnomsn aAPPmcx.

Blest as th’ Immortals is the youth, who nigh thee,
Sitting attentive ‘to thy voice melodicum
Hears thy eost amenta, and beholds thy kind smiles&

Rapture inspiring.

This my hoart oharm’d‚ this stupefied my sensae,
Smit by thy beauty, soon as e'er 1 saw thee,
Tongue-tied 1 gued, and in sost confusion,

Speeohless ador’d thee.

Glow’d my fond bosom; soon tho subtile keen flame
Glid thro' my members with ideal murmure,
Loud my ears tingled‚ and a cloud of darkness

Hung o’er my oye-lide.

Trembling all over, and bedew’d with cold events,
Tarnish'd my visage with a dying palehesS,
Breathless 1 sunk down, with the pleasing languore,
well-nigla expiring.
