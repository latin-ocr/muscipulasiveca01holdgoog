XVI.
Black silence and the chades of hell
The bright etherial flames surprise ;
Abhorr’d o’er since tho rebels fell,

Ejected headlong from the skies.

XVII.
Now, dreadful thunder bellowing loud
Spreads deeolmion as it flies;
And hell, th’ elect’s design’d abedo,

With its deep cavea, in ruin lies.

XVIII.
The raeks of souls lie scatter’d round ;

Strong corda and hooks besmear’d with gore ;
And! death, with formidable anund,

Doth his extorted sting deplore.

XIX.
Lo! from tho deep, Hm mounts to lighss
Drngging helr's monarch from afar ;
And the foul-munstero of the night

Bound vanquish'd εὖ his golden car. ·
