PREFAOE.

The most of the following poems were written between eighty
and ninety years ago 3 and are the production os a respectable
Physician, who died near the close of the last century.

His manuscripts, which are voluminum, and on various sub·
jectS, both literary and scientifick, have remained in the hands
os his family, to the present time3 and the following selection
has been made, merely as a specimen of poetick talent and lit·
erary acquirements. The fate of the residue will depend on

the recgfitilcgn, with which this volume meets, from the Ameri-
can pu c .

The Author was a native os the State of New·York. He was
educated at one os the oldest Colleges in this country, at which,

he graduated at a very early age, and os which, he was aster·
wards an officer.

After completing his professional studies and spending sev-
eral years in the practice of medicin05 with the view of qualisy-
ing himself for more extensive uses n'ness in his profession, he
voluntarily relinquished a lucrative practice, and the endear-
ments os home, and embarked for Europe. In the course of the
voyage, the packet in which he sailed was attacked by a French
privateer, and our author was slightly wounded. He, however,
arrived in safety, and remained nearly three years abroad, not
lounging about the citieS, or fiying from kingdom to king-
dom, merely to gratify an idle curiosity, or to make a boast of
what he had seen and where he had been3 but in the diligent
prosecution of the object, sor which he had lest his native land
and the home os his fond parents, of whom he was then their
only surviving child. A large portion of his time was spent on
the continent: and at one os the oldest universities, he receiv-
ed the degree of M. D. aster undet-going a thorough examina-
tion, as his Diploma certifieS, “ per universam Medicinam ;’' and
delivering a Latin dissertation on an assigned Thesis ς and de-
sending the same, “prompte adversus Professorum opponentium
argumenta objectionesque ;'' in compliance with the' regulations
of the Institution. He also resided several months in the city
of London, where he attended a course os Anatomical Lec-
tures, and enjoyed the privileges os one os the publick Hospitals,
The associations, in which he was then placed, occasioned some
of the most severe satires that ever proceeded from his pen.
