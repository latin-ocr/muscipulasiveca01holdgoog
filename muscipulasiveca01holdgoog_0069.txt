A nummos: omn. A. n. 1757.

   

Bleee, Ο my seul! the Gon of love3
With awo profound adore
The wonders of his healing pow’r‚

'l'hen to me name in lossy numbers raise
A sacred song of solemn praise;
Who in a dangerous hour
Proserv’d of late thy life and lengthen'd out thy days.

Ost hae ΗΒ sav'd my soul srom death ;
Borne up my sinking frame;
Restrain’d my flying breath,
And ealm’d the tumults of the vital stream3
When I’ve lain wasted by some dire disease,
While burden’d nature found no ease,
And 1 drew near the dead ;
0st has his hand suetain’d my head,
Sooth'd all the sorrows of my bed,
And made my anguish cense-
His word pronouno'd the high command,
And hie preserving hand,
His hand omnipotent to eave,
Reetor’d me from the gloomy bol-ders of the grave.
