Having accomplished the object of his tour, procured some
rare and highly valuable additions to his medical library, and
furnished himself with surgical instruments, to an extent, pos-
sessed by few, at that period, in this country, he returned to his
native State, where he continued in the diligent and successful
exercise of his profession, to the time of his decease.

Having been a hard student from his early yearS, and engag-
ed in extensive professional occupation, in reference to which
he continued to read and write with singular diligence, much of
his leisure was devoted to literary pursuits. The success which
attended these efforts may be inferred from the fact, that before
he commenced his foreign traveIS‚ he had made himself master
of seven different languageS‚ several os which were so familiar
to him, that he could converse or compose in them, with nearly
the same facility, asin his mother-tongue. Hence, many of his
MSS. are in those languages. As a literary curiosity, it is wor-
thy of mention, that he has left a Latin versification ot‘ the
ggiVIIitthsalm, in all the varieties of metre, of the different

es o orace.

Nor was his attention confined to mere matters of literature,
but was directed, with equal interest, to those of a scientifick
character. His MSS. show, that the subjects of Chemistry and
Electricity, then in their infancy, and other branches of Natural
Science had not only arrested his attention, but, led him to in-
vestigations and results that would be thought impracticable,
with no other apparatus, than his own mechanical genius and
skill constructed.

From a very early age, our Author manifesteda decid ed taste
sor poetry3 and this species os composition constituted his prin·
cipal relaxation, from the labours of study or professional en-
gagements. Many of his MSS. were injured, and some entirely
destroyed, in the revolutionary war; his house having been re-
peatedly plundered hy the enemy, to whom he was peculiarly
obnoxious, on account of his nndisguised whig principles. Sev-
eral poems of a patriotick character were published at that
time; but owing to the existing circumstances of the country,
they did not excite that attention, to which, it is believed, their
merits entitled them.

The occasion on which the Caunnomromcms, the principat
poem in this selectim, was written, is unknown: and from
some remarks on a blank leaf of the translation, a doubt might
arise, as to his intention of claiming its authorship. This cir-
cumstance. however, is fully explained, on the supposition, that
he was preparing to publish it anonymously, which had been
the uniform mode of all his former publicatione.
