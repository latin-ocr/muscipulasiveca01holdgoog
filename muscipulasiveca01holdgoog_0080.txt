THE DESPERATE WISH‚

ΟΒ

MELANOHOLY EXTRAVAGANCE. A. n. 1760.

1.
Tell me, ye Furiesx, where to find

Some subterranean cave,
Dark as the horrour of my mind,

And silent as the grave.

ΙΙ.
Where none but melancholy things

Possess the dreary plains;
Where darkness spreads her raven-wingffi

And night perpetual reigna-

111.
Near some vast heap of ruins be

Tho desolate abode3
Like those astonish’d trav’lers see,

Where ancient Babylon stood.

IV.
Rubbish should all desorm the ground,

And make a rueful show ς
Wild brambles all the place sul-round,

And nettles rampant grew.
