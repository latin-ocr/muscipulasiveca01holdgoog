ΤΟ A BRAVE OFFICER.

14
If you can’t fight-with such delight

As you can wear a cumb, six-3

Yet well Ι know—that you cau emw,

Come, then, you’re welcome home, sir.

15
Others aspiro—to ranks still higher,

And greater men become, six-3
But you content-plain Captain went,
And such you are come home, sir.
16
You went to quen-that imp of hell,
Ι mean the Pope of Rome, εἰη
And now you may—at leisure slay

The Man os Sin at home, sir.

17
My joyful tongue-has run so long

’Tis almost tir’d ; but mum! sir:

1 cannot stay-but must away-—so once for aye,

You’re very welcome home, sir.

THE END.
