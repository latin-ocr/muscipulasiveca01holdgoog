62 onn-

Hark! the shrill outcriee of the guilty wretches ι

Lively bright horrour and amazing anguish

Stare through their eyelidS, while the living worm lies
Gnawing within them.

Thoughte,like old vultures,pr ey upon their beart-stringe

And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the

Lofty Ionon frowning‚ and a ssood of vongeance
Rolling before him.

Hopeless immortale! how they aeream and ehiver‚

While devils push them to the pit wide yawning

Hideoue and gloomy to receive them headlong‚
Down to the centre. Ι

Stop here, my fancy: (all away ye horrid

Doleful ideam) Come, ariae to ἦπου

How he sits Orod-like, and the saints around him
Thron’d‚ yet adoring.

Ο 2 may 1 sit there when he eomes triumphant,

Dooming the natione! then ascend to glory ς

While our Hosannas all along the passage,

Shout the Rnnnnmm.
