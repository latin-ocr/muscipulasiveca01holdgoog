few exceptione, are covered with vegetation, and enclose
many sequestered glens 3 some of them gloomy and soli·

on the same authority, that “they are exceedingly jealous
of affronts‚ passionate and hasty 3--more jealous of their
liberties than the English, and sar more irascible.” Saye
another—“they are hardy, active, lively, hospitable, kind-
hearted, only a little hot and quarrelsome.” To this last
characteristick the poet here alludes.
