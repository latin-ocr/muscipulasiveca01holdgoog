1.
In story we’re told,

How our fathers of old
Brav’d the rago of the wind and the waves;

And cross’d the deep o’er,

To this desolate shore,
All because they were loath to be slaves 3—Brave boys,
All because they were loath to be slaves.

Yet a strange achibo of late,

Has been form’d in thu state,
By a knot of politic-al knaves;
Who in secret rejoiee,
Thac the Parliament's voice,
Has resolv’d that we all shall be slaves 3-—Brnve boys.

But if we should ΞΜ]

This vile statute, the way
To more base future slavery paves ς
Νοι· in spite of our pain,
Must we ever compium,
If wo tamoly submit to be slav οι ς--Βηνο boys.
