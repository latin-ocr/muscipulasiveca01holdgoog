To our monareh, we know,

· Due allegiance we owe,
who the sceptro so rightfully waves;
But no sov’reign we own,
But the king on the throne,
And cannot, to subjecte, be slaves ;-Brave boys,

Though fools stup?diy tell,

'rhat we mean to rebe13

Yet all each American craves,
Is but to be free,

As we surely must be,
For we never were born to be slaves 3-Brave hoya,

But whoever, in spite,

At American right,
Like insolent Haman behavem3
Or would wish to grow great,
On the spoils of the state,
May he and his children be slaves 3-Brave boys,

Though against ‘gel reponi,

With intemperate zeal,
Proud Gumvmn so brutishly ravee;
Yet our conduct shall show,
And our enemies know,
'rhat Autumnus scorn to be elavem—Breve boys,
