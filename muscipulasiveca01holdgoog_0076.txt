How ert thou sall’n into death’s eruel juwe!
At an untimely date, a sudden prey:
Just in the crisis of thy Country's cause,

Just at the dawn of her triumphant day.

High were thyhopes of our late conquest rais’d,

(But thou, to see the great event, denied,)
When Weshington’s meridien glory blaz'd

Eclipsing splendour on coruwallis’ pride.

Se, eret the giver of the Jewish law,

To enter Cenaen earnestly desir’d;
But the good land from Nebo only saw,

And on the top of Pisgah's mount expir’d.

But the Surenae saw fit to call thee hence,

Where thou, sor sreedom‚ hast eo nobly striv’n3
And doubtleSS, swist wing’d messengere from thence

Oft bear glad tidIngs to the court of heev’n.

There, Scunnnn, thou, we trust, dost glorioue re ign,

By triels, well sor that bright world prepared;
Sharing from liberality divine,

A faithful servant’e exquisite reward.
