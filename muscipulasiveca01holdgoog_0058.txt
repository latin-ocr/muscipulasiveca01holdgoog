THE DAY OF JUDGMENT:
DR. wA'r'rs’ SAPPHIOK oDE,

TRANSLATED mro urm.

When the fieree North wind with his ‘airy forces
Rears up the Baltick to a soaming fury5
And the red lightning, with a storm of hail comes
Rushing amain down3
How the poor sailors stand amaz’d and tremble 2
While the hoeree thunder, like a bloody trumpet,
Roars a loud onset to the gaping wetere,
Quiek to devour them.
Such shall the noise be, and the wild disorder,
(If things eternal may be like these earthly,)
Such the dire terrour, when the great archan gel
Shakes the creation;
Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven,
Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes ;
See the graves open, and the bonee arising,

Flames all around them.
