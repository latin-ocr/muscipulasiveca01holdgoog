CANTO v1.

Down from the mountains, with the morning light,
Descend the Welsh, to see the curione sight, ξ
For all had heard the wonders of the night.

An aes, it seems, from native graveneee freed,

His eloth forgot, as wauton as a kid,

Ascende a mount, and, with a hideous noise‚
Attempts to ape a Cambrian erier’s voice. 270
There eder-like, thrice, to his friends, he bray·

The publiek joye, thrice‚ Taffi, sounds thy praise.
The owl, besides. that hatesul bird of night,

(Since eall'd the Weleh ambaesadon) wing’d her flight,
And ass night roviug, rang’d the eities through, 275
Sail’d thro’ each street, to ev'ry window flew,

Rapp’d with her beak, and whoo’d, with ominous bresith,
How the poor mouse was on the briuk of death.

The mountains labour, and a num’rous throng,
From Merioneth and Pembroke, haste along: 280
Bangor‚ Coenum-then, send their numbers forth,
Caermarthen, famous for sage Manm’s birth.

They come whom fat Glamorgan's fields supply,
Montgomery’ssturdy elownS‚and those thatdrink theWye.
Then Taffi. cireled by th’ attending train, 285
Moeke his fell captive in this seornsul eti-ain.
