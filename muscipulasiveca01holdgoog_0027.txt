Α post, by lolling Cambrians worn, the enge 95
Supports, half-sunk beneath the weight of age;
On this reolin'd, thick huddiing word on word,
. In hollow sounds, he thus address'd the Board.
“We're here conven’d, the oniy refuge left,
“But not of open war t'advise, but theft: 100
‘⁶ Α guest at home, not foreign soes, aiarm83 “
“An ill sar worse than hostiie troops in arms.
“Still shall the mouse tyrannick empire hold ‘3
‘⁶ Stin must his ins'lenoe triumph uncontroll’d3
⁴⁶ No! honour'd FatherS, at a higher rate 105
“I know you prize the sasety of the state:
“By balmy oounsels, then, relieve the paine
“ Your country suffers, while th’ intruder reigns:
“And if there’s hope, the means advis'd pursue,
“Thus give her comfort and deliv’rance too, 110
“As long as great cadwallader’s name is known,
“Yours, ton, shall shine still brighter in renovvn.'’
He said, and straight in view of au the crowd,
Some old mouse-eateu mouldy fragments show’d.
These monuments of suffered rapine seen 115
Whet up their anger to an edge more keen;
Each father’s bosom, with intense desires,
Now rival-vengeanee‚ now ambition fires3
To merit glory and the mouse destroy,
Sti-ange schemen of death their busy thoughts employ;
Each noddle labourS, and, with mental pain, 121
A Mouse·trap’s hammer'd out in ev’ry hrain.
