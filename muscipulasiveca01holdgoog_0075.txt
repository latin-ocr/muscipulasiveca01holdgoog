AN ELEGY. 67
V. ‘

Friendship's pure flame did in thy bosom glow‚
And a kind fervour to thy words impart3
While gentle manners shew’d, thou well didst know,

All the fine feelings of the socia! heart.
vl.
Thou deur companion of my early years!

. I’m taught, when 1 our former lives review,
By beart-felt pange and daily flowing tears,

1 ne'er before, how much I lov’d thee, knew.
vn.
The paths of science we together trud,

Ambitione rivals; yet so kindly strove,
That competition but endear’d the road,

And emulation fann'd the fire os love.
vm.
How did our souls a mutual passion prove,

My brother Sounoua, wonderful and rare Ξ
If not less ardent, less sublime the love,

That wat-ms th’ enraptur’d lover and the fair.

How art thou fall’n‚ Souna-R, highly priz’d;

By what vile hands depriv’d of vital breath 2
A erew, of whom, whole hundreda sacrifio’d‚

Were not sufficient to avenge thy death.
