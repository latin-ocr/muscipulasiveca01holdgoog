That it is of American origin, there' is no reason to doubt. And
that the Translator was sully adequate to the composition os
the original, is evident, from the multifarious productione os
his pen ς if not from the few specimens which this little volume
furnisheS. The Poem has been submitted to the examination
of many literary gentlemen, some os whom were educated in
Europe, who unitedly declare that they never saw or heard
of the work before. That our author did not possess himself
of the poem in his foreign traveIS, is evident from the fact, that
the translation was made shortly after he graduated, which
was before he had attained the twentieth year os his age, and
several years before he sailed for Europe.

That it possesses great merit as a Latin Poem, no person
thoroughly acquainted with that language will venture to dis-
pute. With the bare exception osa few modern names unknown
to the ancients, the Latin is that of the Augustan age. And in
regard to the versification, the whole poem has been repeated-ly
scanned, with entire satisfaction, by classes ofadvanced scholars,
under one of the most accurate teacherS, that the University of
Edinburgh ever furnished to this country. And it has been
said by one well qualified to judge, that ‘ it is written with the
greatest accuracy ; and demonstrates the author to have at-
tained a thorough acquaintance with the Roman 1811311888.-
The numbers are so exact, the language so elegant and pure,
the style so well adapted to the subject, in every part, and the

Of the merits os the Translation, as such, the learned reader
alone is a competent judge. That it should be fully equal to
the original is not to be expected, when we consider the supe·
rior strength and copiousness of the Latin tongue, and the pe·
culiar fitness of its rules of versification‚ especially in heroick
measure, to diversified description. Thereis, however, an apt-
ness and liveliness in this respect, that will not be overlooked
by the scholar. and which cannot sail to interest the mere Eng-
lish reader. Though the translation is not literal, and in some
respects, may be denominated ‘ free,' yet the true sense of the
original is singularly maintained. This last remark applies to
the other translations in the volume. To afford the reader an

opportunity of readily malfing a compsi-ison, the two Odes os
Dr. Watts, the one ln Latin and the other in Enghsh, and an

Ode of Horace, are printed side by side, with their respective

versions. In regard to the English Poems, the mere English
render will be able to form his own opinion. To say they are

superior to much that passes sor poetry, in the present day,
would be saying very little in their favour. And it will be no
