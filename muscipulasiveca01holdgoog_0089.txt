'ro A. BRAVE ormcmt. 81

4
From tents in camp—so cold and damp,

Το your convenient dome, sir,
Safe from the sturm—so dry and warm,
You’re very weleome home, sir.

5
From the bleak coasts—where Northern gusta

Make wild Ontario soum, sir;
To Nassau’s shores—where ocean roars,
You're very welcome home, sir.

From war’s dread noise-the cannon’s voice,

And daily beat of drmm, sir;
To the shrill notes—of female throats,

You’re very weleome home, sir.

7
From savage blades-whose painted heads

Appear so dreadful glum, εἰη
To the sost looks—of civil soum,

You’re very welcome home, sir.

8
From wal-’s alarms—srom fatal harma,

From powder, bullae, bumba, sir3
To Sylvia’s chartus-in Sylvia’s armo,

You’re very weleome home, sit.
