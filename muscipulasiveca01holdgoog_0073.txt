PINDARIOK oDE.

But ah Ξ my rebel heart
still acts a treacherous part,

Forgets the wonders thou hast wrought‚
And wanders from my Gon.

vm.

My Gon, subdue this heart of stone3
Melt all my stubborn passinus down;
anh rebel-wish control ;
By the chastisements thou hast giv'n,
Embitter sin, and teaeh my soul
Entire. submission to the will of heav'n.
To heavenly things exalt my caree,
And from this world's bewitching snare&
Ο ! set my spirit free:
And by thy mercies‚ Lonn, inspiro
My bremt, and set my beart on fite,
With love and zeal and warm desire,
To dedicate my life, and all my powers to THEE.
