But, faithless ia ita hold3 impending fate

Sudden arreata the wreteh that dares to eat:

Soon as the foe but tastes the deadly food,

Down falls the portal freed, and elairns th’ offender’s blood.
All thus in order, Taffi, in a trice, 221

Th’ ensnaring morael to the hook applica.

But that the ebeese, more fragrant, might invite

The distant miee, and keener sense excite,

He toasts it, to diffuse its fatal breath, 225

And thus he makes their food the instrument of death.

And now, the memorable night came on,
When Taffi wearied with hia laboura done;
Seeure os uasety, slumber’d on his bed,
His guardian mouse-trap station’d near his head. 230
Thus, all was hush'd3 meanwhile, that knavish erew,
The wauton mice their nightly sporta renew3
Secure in glooms and silence so profound,
Fearless they wander, play and frisk around.
—Among the rest, one of no vulgar rate, 235
A noble chief, but born t’ a wretched sate,
Quiek·seented, seeks the hostile camp, and goes,
Where, from the eheese‚ the grateful vapour fiown, ξ
And waste delicious odours to his noae.
