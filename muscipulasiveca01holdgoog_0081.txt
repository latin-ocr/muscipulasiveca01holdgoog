THE DESPE RATF. Wlsn.

V.
Dragons should there their statione keep,

And wave their ragged wings;
There vipera hies, foul lizards creep,

‚And scorpione dart their atinga.

vl.
Veracious monsters there should stray.

In quest of human gor03
‘There aavago tigers howl for prey,

And hungry noge roar.

There, perch’d on eat-,thIrIy2 blasted oak,

Should nest each rav’nous sow13
There should the om’nous raven croak,

There scream the odious owl:

V Ι .
No arbours drest in &ng green,

No groves should thero be found!
without a leaf each troo bo seen,

Without a flow’r the ground.

The yew alone and ογριιξὲε thero,

In melancholy state,
should flourish sacred to despair.
