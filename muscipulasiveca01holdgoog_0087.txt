A soNe. '79

With the beests oli'2the wood,

W‘e will ramble for sood,
We will lodge in wild deserts and eeves3
And live poor as Job,
On the skirts of the globe,
Before we’ll submit to be slaves 3—Brave boys,

The birth-right w103 hold,

Shall never be sold,
But sacred maintain’d to our graves3

And before we’ll comply‚

We will gallantly die,
For we must not, we will not be slaves 3-Brave haye,
For we must not, we will not be slaves.
