So bright‚ bless’d shade! thty deeds of virtue shine;
So rich, no doubt, thy recompenso on high:
My lot’e sar more lamentable than thino,

Thou liv’st in death, while Ι in living die.

With great apqplause hast thou perform’d thy part,

Since thy first entrance on the stage of lif03
Or in the labours os the healing art,

Or in fair Liberty’s important strise.
lv,
In med’cine skilsul‚ and in warfare bravo,

In council steady, uncorrupt and 'wise;

To thee, the happy lot thy Maker gave,

To no small rank, in each of these to rise.
v.

Employ’d in constant usesulness thy time,
And thy fine talents in exertion strong;
Thou died’st advanc’d in life, though in thy prime,

For, living useful thou hast lived long.

But 1, alas! like some unfruitful ‚trees

'rhat useless stands, a eumberer of the plain3
My faculties unprofitable see,

And five long years have liv’d almost in vain.
