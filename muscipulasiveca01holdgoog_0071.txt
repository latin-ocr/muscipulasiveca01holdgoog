PanAtucK ons. 63

Half felt the turtures of the deathless worm3
And in the hori-id glonna,
With dire amuzement‚ read my doum
⁶ To never—never—never-ending woe.

V.

But oh! while thus a criminal 1 stood,
By law condemn’d to die,
The prisoner of almighty wrath‚
And thought the execution nigh;
My pitying Jonas, my osten injur’d Gon,
Repuls’d the bold demands of death,
And gave a kind reprieve:
Bade me avoid the sinaei-’s road,
His offer’d grace receive,
And spend my future lise sor him who spat-'d my breath.

VI.

And though the grisly soe,
With all his gloomy terrours arm'd,
Has often since my trembling soul alarm'd‚
Yet Gon has still his tage disarm’d3
Nor would he give
The tyrant leave,
To strike the fatal blow:
And while half victor in the strise,
of late, he almost triumph’d o'er my life,
And unrelenting, saw my kindred mourn3
