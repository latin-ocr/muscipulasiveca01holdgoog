82 'ro A BRAVE OFFICER·

9
From Mohawk squaws-against the lawe,

Converted into strumo, sir;

T’ a sober life—with your own wife,

You’re very weloome home, sir.

10
At your return—through spite and seorn,

Your enemies are dumh, εἰη
But for my part—with all my heart,

1 bid you welcome home, sir.

11
Alive again—from the campaign

I'm glad to see you come, sir;
Safe from the war-without a soar,

You’re very weleome home, sir.

12
The rapid ssight-of balle in fight

Has proved the death of some, εἰη
Your life you chose—not to expose,
Lest you should ne’er come home, sir.
13
You’ve struck no blows--subdu'd no soes,
Nor were you overcome, sir ;
You scal'd no Alps—'tis true, sor scalpe,

Yet you have safe got home, sir.
