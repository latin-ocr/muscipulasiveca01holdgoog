' Innocenoe‚ FuscuS, and unblemish'd virtue

Wants not the Moor’s sharp javelins to guard it‚'
Needs not his strong bow, nor his quiver fraught with
Arrows empoison'd:
Whether one travels through the scorehing send-wasme,
Climbs up rough‚ «told, inhospitable Caucase,
Or the strange soil treads½ where renown'd Hydaspes
Dashes his floods down.
For a wolf lately‚ in a Sabine forest,
Shunn'd ine spontaneouS, though 1 rov’d unarmed,
Singing my charmer, Lalage, beyond boundS,
Thoughtless of danger.
Such a dire monster, neither Daunia war-like
Feeds in her vast woods‚ nor the land of Juba,
Sandy dry desert, and the nurse of lione,
E'er yet produced.
What though you place me, in the barren regione,
where no tree’s foster’d by the summer-'s warm breeze‚
Where the eold snow-elouds and malignam keen air
’ Check vegetation3
What though in hot elimes, never mortal dwelt in„
Under the bright car of the sun too nigh. me,
Charmingly smiling Lalage 1 must love,
Charmingly talking.
