Too weak for victore, and too proud for slaves. 70
All monae-like fied, to steeps and secret caves, ξ
And (περ, a fort that an assault outbraves.

So unmolested, with tho wara beneath,

They skulk’d, with safety, in the midst of death3
And hence, her sons rehem-se a num’rous throng 75
Of annosum-s. and hence, they hold so long ξ
Their land unconquer’d, and their ancient tongum

ln vain the cat her watchsul art employ'd
To catch the mouse, as watehful to avoid:
Thu& when the soe had long escap’d the snare 80
And Cambria’s hopes had vanish'd in despair3
A council's summon’d, on their utmost coast,
Where now St. David's moun-ns her glory lost,

Her ancient fame half-buried in disgra003 85
Fatbers and nobles, and with brimstone strong,
A vu1gar herd promiscuous haste along, ξ

And crowds, from ev’ry qual-ter to the couneih throng.

A grave old father, with as grave a heard: 90

His mountain goats ost view’d it, as it hung,

Invidious leer'd‚ and wish’d their own as long.

His h'ands and sace a scabby covering wore

Nor then alone, but many a year before.
