This my heare charmi, this slupvssed my semes—
On this line of the Ode, the Translator makes the fol-

⁷ lowing critical remark :

“ ΜΓ. Phillips, in his celebrated translation of this ode, as published in Ad-
dison’s Spectator, No. 229, (l humbly conceive‚) mistakes the genuine sense
of the original, iffissi‘* placed His t:'1·(i›.11slation¹ titius tthus:

which seems expressive of an impetuous ruffie, which is a real pain, and in-
compatible with the ha piness supposed in the first stanza, as well as incon·
sistent with the generai'design of the Ode3 which is, 1 think, topi-esent, not
the violent perturbation, but the ecstatick silence, the soft confusion, the gen-
tle, thrilling‚ trembling, panting, dying, and yet pleasing sensatione of love ι
in a word, to describe, not the tumultuous emotions, but the sost languishments
of that tendet passion.”

The correctness of these remarks will be duly appre-
ciated by any on'e who is capable of reading this much ad-
mired ode in the original ; which, it is believed, fully sus-
tains the above criticism.

The date here referred te, as noted on the original man-
uscript (Nov. 7th‚ 1754) constituted an epoch in the author's
life, which appears to have made a deep and lasting im·
pression on his mind ; of which, not only the anniversary,
but even the monthly recurrence is particularly noticed
in his diary for many years. ln consequence, either os
close confinement to study, or some other cause, our au-
thor became subject, for several years, to violent parox-
ysms, that indicated, at least in his own opinion, some or-
ganick derangement at the seat of life ; and induced the
apprehension of a sudden dissolution. The first of these

occurred on the above mentioned day, and is thus noticed:

‘⁶ How solemn and awful is it to reflect on the occurrences of the last even·
ing! 1 came home to my lodgings in a thoughtless‚ secure state, thinking of

γ nothing but the diversions Ι had just left, when, in a moment, nature seemed

mendous were thy prospecte! a In one minute’l eprected to have been in eter-
nity, and appear before the JUDGE of heaven and earth. O! the agonizing
horrourl then felt! What soul so hardy as not to tremble under the imme-
diate expectation of divine wrath! 'rhen 1 would have given ten thousand
worlds sor an interest in the Saviour. Glory be to God, 1 am alive to-day, but
the struggles of nature make it doubtful whether it is not my last.·'

So much seemed necessary to a correct understanding
of the allusione in this Ode. It may be satisfactory to the
reader to add, that, aster several ysare, the recurrence of
these paroxysms entirely ceased ; and the author enjoyed
