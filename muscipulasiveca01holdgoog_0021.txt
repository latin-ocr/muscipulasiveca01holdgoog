nm nonen-‘rizar- 13

Skipp’d here and there, and ravag’d all around,
with tooth malignam nibbled all he found. ξ
Nor left a dish, before he left a wound. ι

No choicest bit escap'd the general pest. 20
This home-bred soe was ev'ry where a guest:

No walls or grates, no barricado’d door

Could brave his thestS, or keep the loaves secure:
For soon he'd gnaw himself a door alone, ’

And boldly feast on dainties not his own· 25

But whilst this pest crept plund'ring round the world.
still safe from vengeanee‚ on his robb’ries hurl'd,
No land with Wales, had equal losses borne3
No other land had equal cause to mourn.
Plenty itself her miseries procui-’d ; 30
Her fragrant eheese the wand'ring mouse allur'd ;
Cheese, to a meuse, a delicate repas&
Most else he nibbleS, sated with a taste3
Not so the eheese3 on this he osten falls,
Gnaws houses out, and feasts upon the wallS. 35
'rh’ afflicted nation now its losses mournS,
And now incensed with rage‚ indignant burns:
They gnash their teeth, and o'er the mountains run,
Resistless wrath impetuous drives them on:
Welsh furious passions ev’ry soul inspire. ⁹ 40
Elame in their breasts, and set them all on fite.
Sulphur, (you’d thought, so hot their tage became‚)
Daub'd nvot their fingere only, but the same ξ
O’erspread their minds, to seed the mighty flama.
