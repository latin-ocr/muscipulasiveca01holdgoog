MEDITATION

OVER A muno PATmN'r.

1.

Well ἱ 1 have done, I can no more,

But must my baffled aim deplore;

I’ll lay my druge and cordials by,

For art is vain and he must die.
11.

When heaven demands a mortal’s bream,

And sainting nature yields to death,

Nor love nor art availe to eave

The tott’ring fabriek srom the grave.
111.

But may 1 in thie mirror see

What 1 ere long must also be!

And while a pitied patient dice,

Reeeive instruction and be wise.
IV.

Fix’d is th’ unalterable date,

Fix'd as the firm dem-ees of fate 3

(And. Ο my seul Ι it may be nigh,)

When heaven will call and 1 must die.
V.

In vain physieians may be near3

In vain my friends may drop a tem-3

For medicines will not relieve,

Nor love procuro an {om-’s reprieve.
