AN nmer- 71

While all around me, likg 1tlhe busy swarms,

'rhat ply the fervent labours of the hive3
Or guide the state, with ardour rush to arms,

Or some less great, but needsul business drive.
vm.

1 see my time inglorious glide away,
Obscure and useless like an idle drone3
And uneonduoive each revolving day,

Or to my country‘s 'int’rest or my own.*
ix.
Greet hast thou liv’d and glorious hest thou died;

Though trait'rous villains have out short thy days ;
Virtue must shine, whatever sate betide,

Be theirs the scandal, and be thine the praise.
x.
Thea, to my soul thy memory shall be,

From glory bright, as from affection, dear;
And while 1 live to pour my grief for thee,

Glad joy shall sparkle in each triekling tear.
xx.
Thy great example too shall fire my breast3

lf heav'n permit, with thee, again 1⁹11 vie:
And all thy conduct well in mine express'd‚

Like thee 1⁹11 live, though 1 like thee should die.
