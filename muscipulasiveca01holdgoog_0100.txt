283. A county in S.Wales‚ deriving its name, as some sup·
pose, from a contraction of the Welsh words Gwald Mor-
gan, or the County of Morgan3 from a Princo of that
name, said to have been killed, 800 years before the birth
of Christ. Others derive the name from Mor, signifying
sea, this being a maritime county.—The Northern part is
«very mountatnous and barren, and, consequently, thinly
inhabited. Here,however, is the source of several streame,
which run to the South, through vales gradually enlarg-
ing, to which they add great fertility. The Soutbern part
is so remarkably fertile, pleasant and populous, that it has
been styled the Garden of Wales. Hence the poet calls it
“Foecunda Glamorgan.'’
