’mn Mones-'rw- 31.

Where first he came, the grates his way control, 240

And bar him entrance3 but too stout his soal

To be repuls'd3 he scorns tho foul disgrace,

Trips round the iron bare, from pIace to place 3

And erisps his noae>v admittance to exploro,

By subtle scent already finds the door. 245

And now, th' irremeable threshold past,

And of his wish, his fatal wish possees’d,

With joyful haste, the banesul bait he seiz’d,

Greedy of death, and with destruction pleas’d. 249
Down dropp'd the portal with a thund’ring sound,

And Taffi waken’d, from his sleep prosound,

On elbow rose3 and, with impatient haste,

Leap’d from his bed, to see his unknown guest.

Meanwhile, the mouse ridiculous in his rago,

With head and feet, fights furious in his enge: 255

And now distraeted‚ urged by mad chagrin,

Now bites the gra-tea, now thrasts hie head between.
—So aa os old, the furious Marsian boar

Entangled, with a fornnidable roar,

Shakes the loose net, which his high fury bounds,

The butt of humera, and the sport of hound83
Adown hie shoulders streame of foam descend,

' And, on his back, ercet the rigid bristles stand. 263
