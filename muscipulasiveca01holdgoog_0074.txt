On the death of Doct. NArnAmu-r, Sounoua, who was
slain in a skirmish with a party of refugam, at Sunnws·
noar, an Junsnv, October lssth, 1781.

“ Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
‘⁴ Tam cari cap1tis3”—liomcss.

1.
Scunmm, my friend, art thou. dear man, no more?

Sad vietim fall’n on Shrewsbury‘s fatal plain!
Must 1 thy end so tragicnl deplere,

In virtue’s cause by murd’rous traitors elain?

11.
More splendid titles* did thy name adora,

When thou, erewhile‚ with unremitting zeal,
Didst losseS, toils and dangers nobly scorn,

A strennuus champion sor the public weal.
111.
But oh! the tender title annn alone

Can speak what language most expressive needs;
How my fond beart, while 1 thy fate bemoan,

Smarts with keen anguish and deep-wounded bleeds.

ιν.
Let those who knew thy publick merite most,

With wreaths of honour decorate thy urn;
With me, the patriot in the man is lost,

And less my country, than my} friend, 1 mourn.
