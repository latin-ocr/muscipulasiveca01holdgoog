THE MOUSE-TRAP. 37

Thus she, in many a diff’rent form, displays 315
Her sevage joy, and gayly eruel plays.
But tir’d. at length, she given her trifling o’er,
And whets her teeth, eud hides her wrath no more.
And, like a lion, greedy to allay
Insatiate hunger, falls upon her prey3 320
With hollow growling, tears the living sood‚
Yet quiv’ring limbs and entrails ting’d with blood.
-Soon as the crowd behold the hatesul got-e,
They about, and fill heav’n’s concavo with uproar.
Eeho, inhabitant of Cambrian ground, 325
Repente the shout, and sends the tumult round.
Resonndo Plinlimmon, tow’ring in the sky,
And Breeknoek’s steopS, and Snowdou hius reply.
The thund’ring clap roars to the neighb'ring stare,
And Offa's dyke loud bellows at the mighty jare. 330
Tun, from ege to age, thino honour’d neme
shall live renown’d, and meet a deathlesn fame:
E’en now, the Welsh thy genereus deede declaro,
And blesa thy mem’ry each revolving year:
still, by the thankful nation, is maintain’d
The signal badge their ancestors ordain’d.
With wreathe of leeke, fresh, redolent and gay,
'They grace their temple& on the genie} day. 338
